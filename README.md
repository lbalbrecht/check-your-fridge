## Description

Bootcamp project 2: a comprehensive food catalogue for consumer use

Cooking is not always easy; for many of us who lead busy lives, it can be a challenge to use the food in the fridge before it expires. Whether it's because of a time constraint or a lack of motivation, the process of cooking a meal can be a hassle. This can lead to unnecessary food waste as well as money wasted on food that goes uneaten.

Check Your Fridge creates a database of food that you have in your fridge. Using Spoonacular API, you can find recipes that use specific ingredients to help you use your food before it expires

[deployed on Heroku](https://check-your-fridge.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

After signing up for or logging into the application, you will be able to input items into your own CYF database; you can organize your items by category and also include an expiration date (although, it is not required)
