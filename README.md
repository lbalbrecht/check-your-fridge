## Description

Bootcamp project 2: a comprehensive food catalogue for consumer use

Cooking is not always easy; for many of us who lead busy lives, it can be a challenge to use the food in the fridge before it expires. Whether it's because of a time constraint or a lack of motivation, the process of cooking a meal can be a hassle. This can lead to unnecessary food waste as well as money wasted on food that goes uneaten.

Check Your Fridge creates a database of food that you have in your fridge. Using Spoonacular API, you can find recipes that use specific ingredients to help you use your food before it expires

[deployed on Heroku](https://check-your-fridge.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage

After signing up for or logging into the application, you will be able to input items into your own CYF database; you can organize your items by category and also include an expiration date (although, it is not required). Click on "Add" at the top of the page and follow the prompt to add a new item. Once the item is entered, click "Click to add to search!" on the item card to add it to the recipe search function. When you want to edit or remove the item, click on the three dots within the item card.
Navigate to the bottom of the page and click "search" with your desired items selected to find a recipe with the ingredients selected. If you wish to save the recipe you find, click the box on the bottom of the recipe and the recipe will save and be available on the "Recipes" page.
